# alpha-micmac
Alpha Micmac is my first bot for the Google Assistant.

As a new Google Home user, I wanted to build something simple, so I looked for an easy use case. My son gave it to me, asking and asking how many time there is one or other letter in a word.

So, Alpha-Micmac is a bot for the Google Assistant, that speaks in french, and answers a few questions :
- Spell me *(a word)*
- How many letters are there in *(a word)*
- How many times is there the letter *(a single letter)* in *(a word)*?

As I said, this is my first bot, so there are useless things in these files, that I did not take time to clean. Sorry for that ;)
